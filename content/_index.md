Hi, my name is **Jacob Salassi**. I am an autodidact, software engineer, security expert and executive leader.

Right now I am exploring startup ideas with my closest friends and doing a bit of [consulting](https://www.dunegroup.xyz).

In past roles:

* I built, lead, and hyper-scaled the **Snowflake** product security team successfully through IPO and beyond, supporting 1000+ engineers with 3 global teams.
<p></p>

* I brought a software engineering mindset to build and lead application security at **Collective Health**.
<p></p>

* I was a principal software engineer on **NetScaler** Gateway-As-A-Service where I helped transform legacy on-prem SSL VPN into the core of **Citrix'** hybrid cloud offering.
<p></p>

* I was the first person at **Citrix** to ever transition from support to software engineering. 
<p></p>

* I taught myself binary exploitation, robotics, and software engineering while working as a network engineer at **Radware**.

I am **@jacob-salassi** on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jacob-salassi), contributing to [DuneGroup](https://github.com/DuneGroup) and [SecMerc](https://github.com/secmerc). You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsalassi/). See things I have [created, written & spoken about](/about).
